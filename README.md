GooglePlacesAutocomplete
========================

This is a sample project I put together to check out the Google Places api in an android app.  It uses the Google Places autocomplete and places end points and parses the results with GSON.  The UI is barebones, it presents the autocomplete results in a dropdown then prints out the lat and lon for the item that you select from the dropdown.

To use this example, you will need to go to the Google API Console and generate a key for the Google Places api.  Then replace the string "your api key here" in GooglePlacesApiWrapper.java with your key.
